# SCSA2D2D Image denoising algorithm [ [FEAST](https://www.feast-solver.org/) Sparse solver based optimization]

The project is an optimization of the Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA) method for image denoising. The SCSA algorithm is used for [signal and image processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?newsearch=true&queryText=Eigenfunctions%20of%20the%20Schr%C3%B6dinger%20Operator).

# Optimization schemes
This project accelerates the SCSA operator eigenfunctions decomposition using [FEAST](https://www.feast-solver.org/) sparse solver :
- **Use Case 1** : [Feast3.0 and MKL solver](SCSA_2D2D_pdfeast/README.md)
- **Use Case 2** : [Feast3.0](SCSA_2D2D_dfeast/README.md)
